# SilverBullet AI Plug

This plug integrates various LLMs (Large Language Models) into [SilverBullet](https://silverbullet.md/), the markdown-based note taking tool, allowing users to perform various AI-related tasks directly within their notes. It requires SilverBullet to work, and also access to either a self-hosted or SaaS LLM such as Ollama, OpenAI (ChatGPT), Google Gemini, etc.

See https://github.com/justyns/silverbullet-ai and https://ai.silverbullet.md/ for more details.
