- **Insert Summary**: Inserts a summary of the selected text or note at the cursor position.
- **Call OpenAI with Note Context**: Sends the note or selected text to OpenAI based on a user-defined prompt.
- **Interactive Chat**:  Have an interactive chat, utilizing the current note as the chat interface.
  - **RAG (**R**etrieval **A**ugmented Generation)**: Search local vector embeddings of all your notes for relevant context to your current chat query and provide it to the LLM.
- **Generate Tags for Note**: Generates tags for the current note using AI.  Custom rules can also be specified to steer towards better tags.
- **Generate and Insert Image using Dall-E**: Generates an image based on a prompt and inserts it into the note.
- **Rename a note based on Note Context**: Sends the note, including enriched data, to the LLM and asks for a new note title.  Custom rules or examples can also be provided to generate better titles.
- **Generate vector embeddings**: Chunks each page, generates vector embeddings of the text, and indexes those embeddings.  No external database required.
- **Similarity search**: Allows doing a similarity search based on indexed embeddings.
- **Note Summary generation and search**: **Experimental** generates a summary of each note, then generates embeddings and indexes that summary to be searched using a similarity/semantic search.
