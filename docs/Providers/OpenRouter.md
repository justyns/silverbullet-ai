[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) provides access to a lot of different models, some of them even being free.  Since it exposes all of these LLMs through an openai compatible api, we can use the openai provider to configure them.

Itâ€™s also possible to configure several different models using the same [openrouter api key](https://openrouter.ai/keys).

```yaml
ai:
  textModels:
  - name: openrouter-auto
    modelName: openrouter/auto
    provider: openai
    baseUrl: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
    secretName: OPENROUTER_API_KEY
  - name: openrouter-mistral-7b-instruct
    modelName: openrouter/auto
    provider: mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct:free
    baseUrl: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
    secretName: OPENROUTER_API_KEY
```

Be sure to create the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` secret in the `SECRETS` page as well.

See https://openrouter.ai/docs#models for a list of models offered by OpenRouter.
