A developer utility command that:

1. Prompts you to enter some text
2. Generates an embedding vector for that text
3. Displays the resulting embedding in the current note

This is primarily useful for verifying your embedding model is configured correctly. For normal usage, embeddings are generated automatically when indexing pages.

See [[Configuration/Embedding Models]] for embedding configuration.
