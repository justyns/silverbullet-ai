Opens an interactive chat panel on the right side of the screen for conversing with the assistant.

**Keyboard shortcut:** ++ctrl+shift+a++ (++cmd+shift+a++ on Mac)

The Assistant panel provides:

- Persistent chat sessions that survive page navigation
- Tool support for reading, writing, and searching notes
- Agent selection for customized behavior
- Token usage tracking against the model's context limit
- Export functionality to save chat history

The panel can also be toggled with [[Commands/AI: Toggle Assistant Panel]].

## Full-Screen Mode

For a larger chat interface (especially useful on mobile), use `AI: Open Assistant (Full Screen)` to open the assistant as a modal dialog instead of a side panel.
