Opens the AI Assistant as a full-screen modal dialog instead of a side panel.

## When to Use

This is useful when:

- Working on mobile devices or smaller screens
- You want more space for the chat interface
- The side panel is too narrow for your needs

## Functionality

The full-screen Assistant has all the same features as the side-panel version:

- Tool support for reading, writing, and searching notes
- Agent selection for customized behavior
- Token usage tracking
- Export functionality

See [[Commands/AI: Open Assistant]] for full details on Assistant features.
