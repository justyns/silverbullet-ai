To change the text generation model used by all commands, or other configurable options, open your `SETTINGS` page and change the setting below:

```yaml
ai:
  # Disabled by default, indexEmbeddings and indexSummary can be set
  # to true to provide the AI: Search command.
  # Be sure to read the relevant documentation and warnings first.
  indexEmbeddings: false
  indexEmbeddingsExcludePages: []
  indexEmbeddingsExcludeStrings: []
  indexSummaryModelName: ollama-gemma2
  indexSummary: false
  
  # configure one or more image models.  Only OpenAI's api is currently supported
  imageModels:
  - name: dall-e-3
    modelName: dall-e-3
    provider: dalle
  - name: dall-e-2
    modelName: dall-e-2
    provider: dalle

  # Configure one or more text models
  # Provider may be openai or gemini.  Most local or self-hosted LLMs offer an openai compatible api, so choose openai as the provider for those and change the baseUrl accordingly.
  textModels:
  - name: ollama-phi-2
    modelName: phi-2
    provider: openai
    baseUrl: http://localhost:11434/v1
    requireAuth: false
