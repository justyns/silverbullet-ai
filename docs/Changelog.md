## 0.4.0 (Unreleased)
- Use a separate queue for indexing embeddings and summaries, to prevent blocking the main SB indexing thread
- Refactor to use JSR for most Silverbullet imports, and lots of related changes
- Reduced bundle size
- Add support for [space-config](https://silverbullet.md/Space%20Config)
- Add support for [[Templated Prompts|Post Processor]] functions in [[Templated Prompts]].
- AICore Library: Updated all library files to have the meta tag.
- AICore Library: Add space-script functions to be used as post processors:
  - **indentOneLevel** - Indent entire response one level deeper than the previous line.
  - **removeDuplicateStart** - Remove the first line from the response if it matches the line before the response started.
  - **convertToBulletList** - Convert response to a markdown list.
  - **convertToTaskList** - Convert response to a markdown list of tasks.
- Add new insertAt options for [[Templated Prompts]]:
  - **replace-selection**: Replaces the currently selected text with the generated content. If no text is selected, it behaves like the 'cursor' option.
  - **replace-paragraph**: Replaces the entire paragraph (or item) where the cursor is located with the generated content.
  - **start-of-line**: Inserts at the start of the current line.
  - **end-of-line**: Inserts at the end of the current line.
  - **start-of-item**: Inserts at the start of the current item (list item or task).
  - **end-of-item**: Inserts at the end of the current item.
  - **new-line-above**: Inserts on a new line above the current line.
  - **new-line-below**: Inserts on a new line below the current line.
  - **replace-line**: Replaces the current line with the generated content.
  - **replace-smart**: Intelligently replaces content based on context (selected text, current item, or current paragraph).
- AICore Library: Add `aiSplitTodo` slash command and [[^Library/AICore/AIPrompt/AI Split Task]] templated prompt to split a task into smaller subtasks.
- AICore Library: Add template prompts for rewriting text, mostly as a demo for the `replace-smart` insertAt option.
- Remove need for duplicate `description` frontmatter field for templated prompts.
- Revamp docs website to use mkdocs (and mkdocs-material) in addition to silverbullet-pub to handle the silverbullet-specific things like templates/queries.
